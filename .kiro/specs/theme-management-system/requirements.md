# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The theme management system will be rebuilt to provide administrators with comprehensive control over the visual appearance of the driving school website. The system will extract and codify the current UI design patterns (emerald/teal gradients, backdrop blur effects, rounded corners, shadow styles) as the default theme, then allow customization of these elements. This system will centralize theme configuration while maintaining the professional, modern aesthetic already established across the contact, about, reviews, and admin dashboard pages.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to rebuild and manage website themes from the admin dashboard, so that I can maintain consistent branding while preserving the current professional design as the default.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is rebuilt THEN it SHALL extract current design patterns (emerald/teal gradients, backdrop blur, shadows) as the default theme
2. WHEN an administrator accesses the theme management section THEN the system SHALL display current theme settings with live preview
3. WHEN an administrator modifies theme elements THEN the system SHALL update the preview in real-time without affecting the live site
4. WHEN theme changes are saved THEN the system SHALL apply changes across all website pages instantly
5. WHEN the system loads THEN it SHALL use the current UI design as the baseline default theme

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to customize the existing gradient color schemes, so that I can adapt the professional emerald/teal aesthetic for seasonal campaigns or branding updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL capture the current emerald-to-teal gradient patterns as the default color scheme
2. WHEN an administrator modifies primary colors THEN the system SHALL generate gradient variations that maintain the existing visual hierarchy
3. WHEN gradient colors are updated THEN the system SHALL apply them consistently to hero sections, cards, buttons, and backdrop elements
4. WHEN color changes are made THEN the system SHALL preserve accessibility contrast ratios and visual consistency
5. IF color combinations fail accessibility standards THEN the system SHALL display warnings and suggest compliant alternatives

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage typography settings based on the current design system, so that I can maintain the established text hierarchy while allowing customization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system rebuilds THEN it SHALL extract current typography patterns (font families, sizes, weights) as default settings
2. WHEN typography settings are accessed THEN the system SHALL display current font configurations with preview examples
3. WHEN font changes are made THEN the system SHALL update headings, body text, and UI elements while preserving the established hierarchy
4. WHEN typography is modified THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive scaling and mobile-first design principles
5. WHEN changes are applied THEN the system SHALL ensure text remains readable across all gradient backgrounds

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to preview theme changes against the current design before applying them, so that I can ensure modifications enhance rather than degrade the established visual quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN theme modifications are made THEN the system SHALL display live previews showing current design elements (hero sections, cards, forms)
2. WHEN preview mode is active THEN the system SHALL show side-by-side comparisons of current vs. modified designs
3. WHEN previewing changes THEN the system SHALL demonstrate how modifications affect gradient backgrounds, backdrop blur, and shadow effects
4. WHEN satisfied with changes THEN the administrator SHALL be able to apply them instantly across all pages
5. WHEN changes are discarded THEN the system SHALL revert to the current established theme state

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system, I want to provide theme presets based on the current design and variations, so that administrators can quickly apply professional themes while maintaining design quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the theme manager loads THEN the system SHALL display the current design as the "Default Professional" preset
2. WHEN presets are available THEN the system SHALL include variations like "Seasonal Green", "Corporate Blue", and "Warm Orange" based on the current design patterns
3. WHEN a preset is selected THEN the system SHALL apply all associated gradients, backdrop effects, and typography while preserving the established layout structure
4. WHEN presets are applied THEN the system SHALL maintain the current professional aesthetic with different color schemes
5. WHEN custom themes are created THEN the system SHALL allow saving them as new presets for future use

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the rebuilt theme system to work seamlessly with the existing component structure, so that theme changes apply automatically without breaking current functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is rebuilt THEN it SHALL integrate with existing Tailwind CSS classes and component structures
2. WHEN themes are updated THEN the system SHALL modify CSS custom properties that control gradients, colors, and effects in real-time
3. WHEN pages load THEN the system SHALL apply current theme values while preserving existing animations and interactions
4. WHEN theme data is stored THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with current component patterns (backdrop-blur, rounded corners, shadow effects)
5. WHEN components render THEN the system SHALL ensure theme changes apply to all existing UI elements without requiring component modifications

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a stakeholder, I want the current professional UI design to be preserved as the default theme, so that the established visual quality and user experience remain intact during the rebuild.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the theme system is rebuilt THEN it SHALL capture and preserve all current design elements as the baseline default
2. WHEN the default theme is applied THEN the system SHALL maintain the exact visual appearance of the current contact, about, reviews, and admin pages
3. WHEN extracting design patterns THEN the system SHALL preserve gradient directions, color stops, backdrop blur intensities, and shadow configurations
4. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL ensure the current emerald/teal color scheme, rounded corner styles, and spacing remain unchanged
5. IF any visual regression occurs THEN the system SHALL provide immediate rollback to the current established design
