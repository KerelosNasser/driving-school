# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature extends the existing "edit mode" functionality to support real-time collaborative editing for pages and components. Administrators will be able to create and edit pages and components in real time using drag-and-drop interfaces, with changes visible to all connected users immediately. The system will also resolve the existing concurrency error: "someone edited the components while I'm supposed to be the admin."

The solution builds upon the existing content management system (page_content and content_versions tables) and edit mode context, adding real-time synchronization, conflict resolution, and enhanced UI capabilities for collaborative editing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Real-time Collaborative Editing

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to edit pages and components with other administrators simultaneously, so that we can collaborate efficiently without overwriting each other's changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator makes changes to page content THEN all other connected administrators SHALL see the changes within 500ms
2. WHEN multiple administrators edit different components simultaneously THEN the system SHALL merge changes without conflicts
3. WHEN two administrators edit the same component simultaneously THEN the system SHALL detect the conflict and present resolution options
4. WHEN an administrator joins an editing session THEN they SHALL see the current state of all ongoing edits
5. WHEN an administrator disconnects unexpectedly THEN their pending changes SHALL be preserved and recoverable

### Requirement 2: Drag-and-Drop Component Management

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to add, remove, and reorder components using drag-and-drop, so that I can quickly build and modify page layouts visually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator drags a component from the component palette THEN the system SHALL show valid drop zones on the page
2. WHEN an administrator drops a component onto a valid zone THEN the component SHALL be added to the page immediately
3. WHEN an administrator drags an existing component to a new position THEN the component SHALL be reordered and other components SHALL adjust accordingly
4. WHEN an administrator drags a component to the trash area THEN the component SHALL be removed from the page
5. WHEN drag-and-drop operations occur THEN all connected administrators SHALL see the changes in real-time

### Requirement 3: Dynamic Page Creation and Navigation Management

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to create new pages and automatically add them to the navigation, so that I can expand the website structure without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator creates a new page THEN the page SHALL be automatically added to the navigation menu
2. WHEN an administrator creates a new page THEN they SHALL be able to set the page title, URL slug, and navigation order
3. WHEN an administrator reorders navigation items THEN the changes SHALL be reflected immediately for all users
4. WHEN an administrator sets page visibility THEN the page SHALL be shown or hidden in navigation accordingly
5. WHEN page creation occurs THEN all connected administrators SHALL see the new page in their navigation immediately

### Requirement 4: Inline Component Editing

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to edit component content and properties directly on the page, so that I can see changes in context without switching between interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator clicks on editable text THEN an inline editor SHALL appear with formatting options
2. WHEN an administrator uploads an image THEN the image SHALL be processed and displayed immediately
3. WHEN an administrator changes component properties THEN the visual changes SHALL be applied instantly
4. WHEN an administrator saves component changes THEN the changes SHALL be persisted and synchronized to other users
5. WHEN component editing occurs THEN the system SHALL show visual indicators of which components are being edited by whom

### Requirement 5: Permission-Based Access Control

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure different permission levels for editors, so that I can control who can perform which editing operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has admin permissions THEN they SHALL be able to create, edit, and delete pages and components
2. WHEN a user has editor permissions THEN they SHALL be able to edit existing content but not create or delete pages
3. WHEN a user has viewer permissions THEN they SHALL be able to see edit mode but not make changes
4. WHEN a user attempts an unauthorized action THEN the system SHALL prevent the action and show an appropriate message
5. WHEN permission levels change THEN the user interface SHALL update to reflect available actions

### Requirement 6: Conflict Resolution and Consistency

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want clear feedback when editing conflicts occur, so that I can resolve them without losing work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a conflict is detected THEN the system SHALL show a clear notification with conflict details
2. WHEN a conflict occurs THEN the system SHALL present options to accept incoming changes, keep local changes, or merge both
3. WHEN conflicts are resolved THEN the resolution SHALL be synchronized to all connected users
4. WHEN the system detects the "someone edited the components while I'm supposed to be the admin" error THEN it SHALL provide specific guidance for resolution
5. WHEN optimistic updates fail THEN the system SHALL rollback local changes and refresh from the server

### Requirement 7: Audit Trail and Change History

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to see who made what changes and when, so that I can track modifications and revert changes if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any content change is made THEN the system SHALL record the user, timestamp, and change details
2. WHEN an administrator views change history THEN they SHALL see a chronological list of all modifications
3. WHEN an administrator selects a historical version THEN they SHALL be able to preview the content at that point in time
4. WHEN an administrator chooses to revert THEN the system SHALL restore the selected version and create a new history entry
5. WHEN changes are reverted THEN all connected users SHALL see the reverted state immediately

### Requirement 8: Concurrency Error Resolution

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the system to prevent and resolve the existing "someone edited the components while I'm supposed to be the admin" error, so that I can edit content reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the concurrency error occurs THEN the system SHALL capture detailed logs including user sessions, timestamps, and conflicting operations
2. WHEN the error is reproduced THEN the system SHALL identify the root cause (race conditions, stale state, or session conflicts)
3. WHEN the fix is implemented THEN the system SHALL prevent the error through proper locking, versioning, or conflict resolution
4. WHEN the fix is deployed THEN automated tests SHALL verify the error no longer occurs under concurrent editing scenarios
5. WHEN similar concurrency issues arise THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without data loss

### Requirement 9: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the real-time editing system to perform well under normal load, so that administrators can work efficiently without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN up to 5 administrators edit simultaneously THEN the system SHALL maintain sub-500ms response times
2. WHEN real-time updates are sent THEN they SHALL be delivered within 200ms under normal network conditions
3. WHEN the system is under load THEN it SHALL prioritize critical operations (save, conflict resolution) over non-critical ones (presence indicators)
4. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL queue changes and synchronize when connection is restored
5. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade non-essential features while maintaining core editing functionality

### Requirement 10: User Experience and Visual Feedback

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want clear visual feedback about the editing state and other users' activities, so that I can coordinate effectively with other editors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN another administrator is editing a component THEN the system SHALL show a visual indicator with their name/avatar
2. WHEN changes are being saved THEN the system SHALL show a saving indicator
3. WHEN conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL highlight conflicted areas with clear visual cues
4. WHEN drag-and-drop is active THEN the system SHALL show valid drop zones and preview the result
5. WHEN the system is offline or disconnected THEN the interface SHALL clearly indicate the connection status and available actions
