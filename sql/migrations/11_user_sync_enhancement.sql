-- Migration: User synchronization enhancement
-- This migration ensures that users who exist in Clerk but not in Supabase 
-- are automatically created when they try to access protected resources

-- No schema changes needed, but this migration documents the enhancement
-- to automatically create users in Supabase when they exist in Clerk but
-- are not yet synced.

-- The enhancement has been implemented in the API routes:
-- 1. app/api/create-quota-checkout-enhanced/route.ts
-- 2. app/api/create-quota-checkout/route.ts

-- These routes now automatically create users in Supabase if they exist in Clerk
-- but haven't been synced yet, preventing the "User not found" error.

-- The updated implementation also handles the case where a user with the same email
-- already exists in the database but without a Clerk ID, by linking the Clerk ID
-- to the existing user record.

-- This approach ensures a seamless user experience where users can immediately
-- make purchases after signing up through Clerk without any manual sync steps.
